# Ubuntu Localization Tool 🐧

A professional localization tool powered by Gemini AI, designed to translate Ubuntu OS `.po` files into indigenous languages (Burmese, Shan, Mon, Karen, etc.) with high technical accuracy.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Translation:** Leverages Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to handle complex software strings.
- **Linux/Ubuntu Context:** Specifically tuned to recognize and preserve technical terms like `Kernel`, `Repository`, `GNOME`, and `Sudo`.
- **Smart File Export:** Automatically generates exported files with language tags and timestamps (e.g., `translated_shan_messages_20260212.po`).
- **User-Friendly UI:** Built with Streamlit for a clean, professional, and easy-to-navigate interface.
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress bar to keep track of your translation work.
